A diffusive memristor is a promising block designed for brain-inspired computation and creates a great potential for their application in neuromorphic systems. It consists of an exchange layer of two platinum (or gold) electrodes sandwiching a dielectric film, and embedded silver nanoparticle clusters (SiOxNy:Ag, HfOx:Ag or MgOx:Ag). Compared with the three-terminal CMOS synapse circuit, this two-terminal device can greatly reduce the footprint, complexity and power consumption, and also does not require complex circuits to simulate the behavior of the synapse.
In this project, we will make use of Simulink to establish the model of diffusive memristor and emulate the behavior of the synapses through it.
